"The Responsive Hyperlink option will swap the video iFrame with a simple "
"hyperlink to the video URL (if the screen is smaller than the specified "
"breakpoint). On mobile and handheld devices, it is often a better experience to "
"watch the video in the native application or media player. This option tries to "
"enable that better experience. When this option is enabled, the video will show "
"up as a hyperlinked image instead of an actual video player."
